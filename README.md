- 👋 Hi, I’m @AndrijaVarga, an 18 year old software engineering student from Umag, Croatia
- 👀 I’m very interested in web development, mobile development and data science although web development is currently my main focus
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development, Javascript and I just recently started to learn Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web projects (please keep in mind that I'm still a student with not much experience)
- 📫 How to reach me?
